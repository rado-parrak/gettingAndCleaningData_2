# gettingAndCleaningData_2

After downloading the data (step 0), you should 

- unzip the file into folder "dataset"
- leaving the unzipped folder in the working directory and 
- keeping the structure of the folder unchanged.

Then you'll be able to move to the next step of the code (step 1), which reads the data in and completes the first task.
The code then follows the structure of the tasks mentioned in the exercise.

You can find the comments on what is happening inside the code.
